# Codex efficiency fix cycle — hypothesis log

**Started:** 2026-07-30
**Spec:** `superpowers/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-codex-efficiency-fixes-design.md`
**Branch:** `codex-efficiency-fixes` (off `dev`)
**Arm:** `/tmp/sp-arm-fix` (detached worktree; refresh before any later
battery with `git -C /tmp/sp-arm-fix checkout --detach codex-efficiency-fixes`)

This is an append-only log, from its first entry onward. Predictions are
written before a battery runs and are never edited after the fact; verdicts
get appended under each entry as batteries complete.

Standing rules carried over from the campaign log
(`2026-07-28-codex-efficiency.md`):
- **Pre-registration before batteries** — every battery gets a hypothesis-log
  entry (prediction, scorer, criterion) written before it runs.
- **Manual match inspection** — scorer matches on fix-arm runs get manually
  inspected, not trusted blind (non-circular verification).
- **No raw rollouts committed.**
- **Discrimination rule** — inconclusive-by-zero is a stop, not a pass.

## Pre-registered criteria (from the approved spec)

### T1. SDD worker-review prohibition

**Criterion:** 0 worker-issued depth-2 spawns AND review coverage preserved
(every task still gets exactly one controller-dispatched task review).

### T2. Event-driven waiting

**Criterion:** timeout rate < 25% with no loss of task completion.

### T3. codex-tools.md corrections

**Graded by:** source citation (already verified); no scorer regressions on
the shared battery. `score_e8.py` is retained as a V1/V2 schema detector,
not a hygiene grader — no `close_agent` checklist ships.

### T4. Brainstorming three-path router (variant C: approval always)

**Graded by (three layers):**
1. **Micro** (`ceremony-path-micro.py`, adapted): variant C literal text,
   plus adversarially ambiguous briefs the campaign never tested (a task
   that pattern-matches bounded but hides a public interface change).
   Criteria: spike/bounded/arch differentiate (≥4/5 per cell); ambiguous
   briefs escalate to FULL (≥4/5); arch never downgrades (5/5).
2. **Codex ceremony battery:** `cx-ceremony-{spike,bounded,arch}` on the fix
   arm, 3 reps each, `score_e4.py` census. Criteria: bounded reps show an
   approval turn but zero committed spec files and zero writing-plans
   ritual; arch reps keep the full two-doc flow; spike reps stay minimal.
3. **Global regression battery:** the same three ceremony scenarios on
   Claude Code and Gemini (rig work: those scenarios are currently
   codex-gated), 3 reps each; plus the triggering acceptance check ("Let's
   make a react todo list" auto-triggers brainstorming into the
   full/architectural path) on all three harnesses.

### T5. Explicit model on child-issued spawns

**Criterion:** every spawn at every depth carries explicit model + effort.
Pre-registered caveat: if T1 eliminates depth-2 spawns entirely, T5 grades
as root-spawn regression (hold 100%) plus doc correctness and is recorded
inconclusive-by-zero at depth-2 — the config backstop is then the operative
mechanism.
