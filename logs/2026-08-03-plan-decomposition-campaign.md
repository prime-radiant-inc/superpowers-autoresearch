# Plan-Decomposition Campaign Log (2026-08-03)

Append-only; corrections are dated entries. Standing discipline carried
forward from the backlog campaign log header, plus the two rules minted
there: (1) every battery pre-registration states HOW the arm text is
reachable from the scenario's execution path; (2) base-rate replication
is pre-registered whenever a pathology's existence is the treatment's
justification. Design: docs/2026-08-03-plan-decomposition-campaign-design.md.
Plan: docs/plans/2026-08-03-plan-decomposition-campaign.md. Budget ≈$836
at open.

## 2026-08-03 — Campaign open

Empirical cornerstones inherited (see design §"Empirical foundation"):
authority gap, attention routing, structural-dedupe constraint, x2b
lens effect size, cost anchors, fresh-session localization. Arms will
use pd/* local branches off sim/dev-postmerge @ 1fed99d.

## 2026-08-03 — Task 4 pre-registration: P1/P2 battery (pd-pipeline + pd-overflow)

**Arms:** control @ 1fed99d; pd-p1 @ ee0c6b0; pd-p2 @ 292da9c
(includes x7a ea84cf9 — p2's effect is measured RELATIVE to control,
so any x7a main-effect is bundled; the composed cell + prior x7a
batteries bound that confound and the p1p2-vs-p1 contrast isolates the
p2 mechanism); pd-p1p2 @ 1a1a8fd (composition defect found and fixed
at drafting: p1's dont-hold-task-files rule vs p2's value-table need —
the preflight is defined as the controller's one pass).

**Cells:** pd-pipeline {control, p1, p2, p1p2} ×3 (12 reps);
pd-overflow {control, p1} ×2 (4 reps). Lane A: pipeline-control ×3,
pipeline-p2 ×3, overflow-control ×2. Lane B: pipeline-p1 ×3,
pipeline-p1p2 ×3, overflow-p1 ×2. Est. ~$8-10/pipeline rep,
~$12-18/overflow rep ≈ $140-170.

**Reachability:** all arm text lives in writing-plans + SDD SKILL.md;
the scenario's opening message explicitly invokes BOTH skills
(authoring then execution) — reachable by construction on every arm;
p1's directory instruction binds at authoring, p2's at SDD setup.

**Criteria:** (1) PRIMARY (P1): plan shape — directory adoption
(score_pd_planshape: form, file count, task sizes) + return-window
failures (baseline expectation: possibly zero even in control on
pd-pipeline; pd-overflow is the discriminating scenario, and
OVERFLOW-OCCURRENCE IS A MEASURED OBSERVABLE — if overflow-control
shows 0 return-window failures, the P1 overflow claim is
INCONCLUSIVE-BY-INSUFFICIENT-SIZE and the probe expands before any
conclusion (T3 size model honestly reached only ~10-20k tokens).
(2) PRIMARY (P2): coherence — cross-module divergence count in final
trees (score_pd_coherence tree mode) + the cross-cutting constant
family presence lines; plan-text divergence caught-and-amended at
preflight (ledger/plan-diff evidence). Baseline: pd-pipeline's
constant family seeds natural divergence pressure via the spec.
(3) Guards: completion parity (post-checks), dispatch counts within
control range (p1 must not inflate dispatches), review rounds, cost.
(4) Micro-edit disposition + YAGNI markers recorded as observables for
P4's later design (not criteria here).

**Scorer caveat (registered):** observables_from_verdict +
return_window_failures meet their first real reps in this battery —
scorer-vs-reality discrepancies are instrument findings first, data
second (T2 ⚠️ carried).
